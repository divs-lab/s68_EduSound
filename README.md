EduSound: Cost-effective Earphones for University Students

Project Overview:

EduSound wants to offer premium, reasonably priced earbuds made especially for college students. This product will combine cost with dependable performance in response to the growing demand for portable audio solutions for studying, enjoyment, and online classes. The earbuds, which offer excellent sound quality, comfort, and durability at an affordable price point, will be designed with both instructional and casual listening in mind.

Key Features:

Affordable Price Point
Long Battery Life (6-8 hours)
Comfortable Design
Noise Isolation
Bluetooth Connectivity
Sweat and Water-Resistant
Microphone for Calls/Virtual Classes
Quick Charge
Customizable Sound Profiles
Frontend of the tech stack:

Mobile App Development:

React Native for cross-platform (iOS & Android) mobile applications.

UI/UX Design:

For wireframes and design, use Adobe XD or Figma. Backend:

Node.js and Express.js are used for the backend API and database, respectively. Firebase or MongoDB for the database (for app data and user profiles).

For secure sign-ins, use Firebase Authentication.

Integration of Hardware:

Bluetooth Technology:

Using Bluetooth 5.0 to pair quickly and reliably.

**Support for Audio Codecs: **

For improved sound quality and effective audio transmission, choose AAC, SBC, or aptX.

Why This Project:

This project is relevant because it addresses the needs of a large group of students who often struggle to find affordable yet quality tech products. Earpods have become essential for everyday use in educational environments, whether for listening to lectures, participating in virtual classrooms, or simply unwinding with music. By focusing on a price-conscious student demographic, this project provides real value.

Additionally, working on this project will allow us to develop a range of skills, from hardware integration and audio tech to full-stack app development. We'll also gain insights into product design, user experience, and the complexities of combining both hardware and software in a consumer product.
